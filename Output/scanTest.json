   "4": "Project name: Balla Balla Infrastructure Project (BBIP)",
   "5": "Description of the project: BBIG Group (BBIG) is proposing the BBIP, a rail and port development. When constructed, it will comprise an integrated port and rail infrastructure system that will provide a new gateway to the iron ore miners in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Initial planned annual capacity of the rail and port is 50 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) (wet) with the potential to increase throughput.   The BBI port is located approximately halfway between Dampier and Port Hedland in close proximity to road, gas and electrical infrastructure.  Proposed infrastructure for the BBIP includes moving iron ore from stranded central Pilbara mines via train loading, a 165 km single-track standard gauge railway and a multi-user port facility capable of handling and loading transhipment shuttle vessels (TSVs).
