Any relaxation of the Project Specifications (where approved by the Project's engineering group) for a particular work package will be notified to all bidders during the pre-award phase to ensure all bidders are provided with equal opportunity to submit their bids on an equivalent basis.",

   "71": "Note:",
   "72": "The supply of all goods and services required to support the Operational phase is a key requirement of the Operational Readiness Stage Gate Review. The identification of suppliers for all goods and services and (as applicable) the entering into of term service contracts, is a critical element of demonstrating Operation Readiness prior to handover and start-up. Each key supply item required to support the operational phase will be identified during engineering, listed and tracked against the Operational Readiness Schedule to ensure all goods and services have either contracts in place or are available in the market from identified suppliers. ",
   "73": "Upon approval of the AIP Plan, the Project proponent will:",
   "74": "Conduct an awareness campaign to all affected Operations personnel commencing with the issue of the Clean TeQ AIP Policy summarised as per this AIP plan;",

   "80": "Sponsor the implementation of document management and reporting systems that capture and record compliance data for inclusion into the AIP Plan Compliance Report.",
   "81": "Note: During the Project phase, and prior to handover to Operations, the Operations Contracts and Procurement Group will report directly to the Project Contracts and Procurement Manager. Each group will share both the AIP Coordinator and common systems and procedures for the implementation of Clean TeQ Sunrise Pty Ltd's AIP Plan obligations thus ensuring a seamless transfer of AIP requirements from the Project through to Operations.",
