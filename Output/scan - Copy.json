When constructed, it will comprise an integrated port and rail infrastructure system that will provide a new gateway to the iron ore miners in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Initial planned annual capacity of the rail and port is 50 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) (wet) with the potential to increase throughput.   The BBI port is located approximately halfway between Dampier and Port Hedland in close proximity to road, gas and electrical infrastructure.  Proposed infrastructure for the BBIP includes moving iron ore from stranded central Pilbara mines via train loading, a 165 km single-track standard gauge railway and a multi-user port facility capable of handling and loading transhipment shuttle vessels (TSVs).

Expanded capacity allows for the potential processing of third-party gas resources through the Pluto LNG facilities, including the proposed Scarborough Development.                                                                                                            The proposed expansion is based on a modular design with production capacity of about 5 Mtpa.  The second train would be accommodated within the existing pre-disturbed Pluto LNG footprint.  Woodside invited two EPC contractors to submit proposals for the design and construction of Pluto Train 2 based upon their experience of similar projects internationally.  Subsequently, Woodside selected Bechtel as its preferred contractor to undertake FEED and with an option to construct the project subject to FID.  Woodside and Bechtel have entered into negotiations to finalise contract arrangements for the work, based upon Bechtel's proposal which reflects a proven design that it has previously constructed in Australia.

   "38": "It is proposed to amend the Migration Regulations 1994 ('the Migration Regulations') to authorise the disclosure of information. The disclosed information, including names, addresses, sex, date of birth and immigration status of Subclass 050 or 051 visa holders (referred to as Bridging E Visa 'BVE' holders hereafter) in the community to the Australian Federal Police or  police force or police service of a State or Territory.  This disclosure is for the purpose of supporting or otherwise facilitating, the compliance activities of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the department). The Australian Government has become increasingly concerned about BVE holders who engage in criminal conduct after being released into the community from immigration detention.  ",
   "39": "The disclosure of information would help federal, state and territory police services to inform the department, as soon as reasonably practicable, that a BVE holder has been charged with a criminal offence.  This will support and facilitate the department's compliance activities, specifically by allowing prompt consideration of visa cancellation.  Section 116(1)(g) of the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) and Regulation 2.43(1)(p) and (q) provide that a BVE may be cancelled if:",
   "40": "the person has been charged or convicted of a criminal offence in Australia or another country;",
   "41": "the person is subject to an Interpol notice relating to criminal conduct or a threat to public safety or for the purpose of locating and arresting the person; or ",
   "42": "the head of an Australian law enforcement or a security agency has advised that a Bridging E visa holder is under investigation and should not hold that visa.",
   "43": "Additionally, the proposed amendments assist in the continuation of a cooperative working environment between the department and federal, state and territory police services, enabling information sharing and collaborative work practices.  ",
   "44": "Human rights implications",
   "45": "This legislative instrument engages human rights related to Privacy; as recognised in article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).",
   "46": "Article 17 states:",
   "47": "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, not to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.",
   "48": "Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.",
   "49": "This legislative instrument may be considered to place a limit on the privacy of BVE holders in the community.",
   "50": "The right to privacy as outlined in article 17 of the ICCPR is not absolute and may be limited in the interests of public order.  In this instance, the intention of the government in providing personal information relating to BVE holders in the community to federal, state and territory police services is a legitimate policy objective, namely to support existing discretionary cancellation provisions in the Migration Regulations.",
   "51": "Section 189(1) of the Act requires that if an officer knows or reasonably suspects that a person in the migration zone is an unlawful noncitizen the officer must detain the person.  The requirement to detain unlawful noncitizens applies to people whose visa has expired or who have had a visa cancelled or refused, and have become unlawful as a result of not departing Australia.  Mandatory detention also applies to any unauthorised arrivals who do not hold a visa, in order to establish health, identity and security risks.  ",
   "52": "The Minister has personal, nondelegable powers to grant a person in immigration detention a visa.  A particular concern is the risk of a person becoming involved in criminal activity after the Minister has personally intervened to release people into the community who would otherwise be in immigration detention.  In response, on 29 June 2013, additional discretionary cancellation provisions (Regulations 2.43 (p) and (q)) were introduced.  Additionally, a new visa condition (condition 8564) was introduced for people granted BVEs which requires that they do not engage in criminal conduct.",
   "53": "The objective of the proposed Regulation change is to disclose information to relevant federal, state and territory police services to support the compliance work of the department, specifically cancellation of visas where appropriate.  The proposed Regulation change is intended to ensure that the police are able to readily identify if a BVE holder has been charged with a criminal offence.  The provision of name, residential address, date of birth, sex and immigration status will provide the police with more than one personal identifier to cross check, ensuring a positive identification.  This would facilitate information sharing between police services and the department, so that appropriate cases can be referred to the department for consideration of visa cancellation.",
   "54": "The effect of the proposed Migration Regulation change would be limited to those people holding a BVE, and so would not apply to people on other temporary visas or on permanent visas.  ",
   "55": "In order to implement the proposed Migration Regulation change, the department intends to put in place formal arrangements through Memoranda of Understanding with federal, state and territory police services to cover the disclosure of the specific information and the Minister's expectations about how they will use it.  ",
   "56": "Information sharing with police services ensures that information is maintained within a controlled and protected environment with access within the relevant organisations limited to those with a need to know.  Standard compliance with information disclosure and storage requirements contained within Commonwealth, State and Territory laws, along with applicable internal governance remain in effect.  The Memoranda of Understanding will address privacy and security requirements and the need to limit further dissemination of information not authorised by law. ",
   "57": "Under the proposed amendments, disclosures of information made by the department will be consistent with the Privacy Act 1988. ",
   "58": "The limitation of privacy contained in this legislative instrument is reasonable and lawful and required for federal, state and territory police services to assist and maintain public order. This limitation will support the Department's compliance activities, specifically by allowing prompt consideration of visa cancellation. As such, there is a clear and rational connection between the objective of this legislative instrument and the limitation of the right to privacy.  ",
   "59": "The department wrote advising the Privacy Commissioner of the intention to make a change to the Migration Regulations regarding the disclosure of information about BVE holders to Federal, State and Territory police and seeking his feedback.  ",
   "60": "In his written response, the Privacy Commissioner raised a number of issues.  These included his recommendation that careful consideration is given to the 'proportionality' of the proposed approach in terms of the potential risks to individuals should their personal information be compromised.  ",
   "61": "The department considers that the limitation of privacy in the proposed change to the Migration Regulations is in proportion to the policy objective.  Immigration detainees may be released on a BVE if they do not pose a risk to the Australian community.  There is an expectation that BVE holders do not engage in criminal conduct of any kind while they reside in the community.  In cases where it becomes obvious that the BVE holder does become a risk to the community, there is an expectation that the Minister and department act in a timely manner.  This expectation is especially heightened when the person has been granted a BVE by the Minister using his personal powers, and in such cases, the grant of a BVE is a privilege and not an entitlement, as the BVE holder has not met the eligibility criteria that would otherwise be required by the migration legislation.  ",
   "62": "The Privacy Commissioner also commented that where an amendment to the Migration Regulations requires or authorises the department to disclose information to police, that this would be permitted under the current Information Privacy Principle 11.1 of the Privacy Act 1988, and will also be permitted under the Australian Privacy Principles when they come into effect on 12 March 2014.",
   "63": "The Privacy Commissioner recommended that the proposed Migration Regulation be drafted narrowly to constrain the use and disclosure of the personal information consistent with the spirit and intent of the Privacy Act 1988.  He suggested that the Migration Regulations clearly describe the kind of personal information disclosed, that the information is only disclosed about those who hold a BVE, and it specify the purpose for which the information is disclosed.  He advised that the authorised use and disclosure of personal information is clearly limited to that necessary to achieve the policy objective of the proposal.  Additionally, the Privacy Commissioner raised the risk of using 'identifiers' such as visa numbers and commented on their heightened privacy risks. ",
   "64": "The department accepts the advice of the Privacy Commissioner on this issue and have narrowly drafted the proposed Migration Regulation to clearly describe the information that may be disclosed.  This information is specified as only name, residential address, sex, date of birth and immigration status.  The proposed regulations will only to apply to those who currently hold a BVE, not to those whose BVE has ceased or who have been granted another visa, for instance.  There are no 'identifiers' of the kind described as a risk by the Privacy Commissioner in the draft Regulations.  ",
   "65": "The proposed Migration Regulation also authorises that the information may be disclosed only if the Minister reasonably believes that the disclosure is necessary or appropriate for the performance and exercise of powers under the Migration Act.  Disclosing information to identify BVE holders to police forces and police services supports an existing discretionary cancellation provision in the Migration Regulations.  Providing information to police about BVE holders ensures that the police will be able to identify if a person who is charged with or convicted of a criminal offence is a BVE holder and will enable the police to inform the department in a timely way.  ",
   "66": "The Privacy Commissioner also provided feedback on the proposed Memoranda of Understanding with the Federal, State and Territory police to support the operation of the proposed Migration Regulations.  He noted that the Memoranda of Understanding provides an opportunity to ensure consistent privacy practices and procedures are implemented by all police services and police forces.  In particular, the Memoranda of Understanding should specify that the information is only used for the purposes outlined in the Migration Regulations, clear procedures are established to identify if a person charged with a criminal offence holds a BVE, and that there are clear practices, procedures and systems to ensure the security of the information disclosed.  ",
   "67": "The department will take into account the recommendations the Privacy Commissioner has made when the Memoranda of Understanding are drafted with relevant police services and police forces.  The intention is that these Memoranda of Understanding will set out the procedures to disclose and manage the information about BVE holders, and with the policy objective of supporting the department's compliance operations.  ",
   "68": "The department welcomes and accepts the feedback from the Privacy Commissioner and believes that the proposed Migration Regulation change is consistent with the Privacy Act.  The limitation of the right outlined in this legislative instrument is reasonable and not arbitrary interference and is at the minimum level required in order for the government policy objective to be achieved and risks to the Australian community to be managed.",
   "69": "Article 9(1) of the ICCPR - prohibition on arbitrary detention",
   "70": "As this legislative instrument supports the Department's compliance activities, specifically by allowing prompt consideration of visa cancellation and, therefore the possible re-detention of the BVE holder, Article 9(1) of the ICCPR is engaged. ",
   "71": "Article 9(1) of the ICCPR states that:",
   "72": "Every person has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.",
   "73": "Australia takes its obligations to people in immigration detention very seriously.  The Australian Government's position is that the detention of individuals requesting protection is neither unlawful nor arbitrary per se under international law.  Continuing detention may become arbitrary after a certain period of time without proper justification.  The determining factor, however, is not the length of detention, but whether the grounds for the detention are justifiable.",
   "74": "In the context of Article 9, detention that is not 'arbitrary' must have a legitimate purpose within the framework of the ICCPR in its entirety.  Detention must be predictable in the sense of the rule of law (it must not be capricious) and it must be reasonable (or proportional) in relation to the purpose to be achieved.",
   "75": "As stated above, a BVE may be cancelled as a result of the information sharing powers introduced by the proposed amendments, in circumstances where grounds for cancellation exist.  The objective of this proposal is to ensure the safety of the Australian community and to preserve those rights owed to Australian citizens pursuant to the ICCPR where such rights may be jeopardised by the conduct of a BVE holder.

The provision of name, residential address, date of birth, sex and immigration status will provide the Police with more than one personal identifier to cross-check, ensuring a positive identification.  This will facilitate information sharing between the Police and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection ('the Department'), so that cases that come to the attention of the Police can be referred to the Department for visa cancellation to be considered, if appropriate.",

Public art may be located in or part of a public space or facility and can be commissioned by both the public and private sector.

   "2": "It was sad really. Looking at a man I couldn't recognise with a melancholy look draped across his face. There was something about his look that was familiar. The sadness in his young eyes was like the ocean clawing at the sand on the beach, strong and rough.",
   "3": "He looked desperate for me to remember him, like he would do anything to give back my memories, but all I was familiar with was that sad look on his face. It was like I was reliving all of the bitter parts of my life, although there were no bitter parts to remember.",
   "4": "It was cold that night. So cold actually that it hurt with every breath. I was flustered, scared and unsure of what to do. I felt that if I took a step my bones would shatter, or maybe it was my fear of seeing her lying there, head bleeding, like she was a puppet with her strings cut, making me feel the cold so much stronger.",
   "5": "He stayed with me, clinging to something, but I wasn't sure of what. I let him stay for a while, I guess maybe I could see something in him. A shadow of sorrow hanging off his every move. I could see it in his eyes, maybe there was even more than that. Anger was my first thought, but how could I know?",
   "6": "I felt agitated around him but mostly I felt sorrow for him. In some way, I felt I had let him down. It haunted me how heartbroken someone could be, someone I couldn't even recognise.",
   "7": "She was skipping around like it was her first time using legs. It was funny really, for someone so mature to be dancing as confidently as she did that night. ",
   "8": "Silence lay across the street as she danced and skipped her way through town. Everything was perfect, a night to remember, a night to become an anniversary. I was ready. The ring grew cold in my coat pocket as it sat alone, aching to be said yes to.",
   "9": "I felt nervous but she was happy, and I watched as she stained the world with her happiness as she danced along. Then all of a sudden, her happiness stopped. It happened so quickly I felt like I was the one who was struck. I ran to her, but not in the elegant way she did. It was too late, the damage was done.",
   "10": "A ring was held between his shaking fingers. It too looked sad, like it never got the answer it was hoping to receive. He placed it on the bed and turned to leave. It was sad really, that melancholy look was the first thing I saw, something that felt familiar, something that I may have once known, and now it was leaving. ",
   "11": "The ring was resting in the palm of my hands. There was a messaged engraved for my eyes only to see. It read;",
   "12": "'Bound together by a loop of gold, forever and always we shall hold.' ",
   "13": "However, the bond had been broken and the one thing that felt familiar had left, leaving only a sorry ring and a forgotten past."
